# real_estate_agency

The project was made for educational purposes!

A desktop application was made for a metamorphic real estate organization for the sale and rental of housing

During the creation of the application, I studied the capabilities of C# for working with databases via ADO.NET

A database model was created on the skl server and connected to the project in visual studio, written in C#
The interface part is written on the WPF framework (XAML)

To use it, you need to open it in Visual Studio, having previously downloaded the archive and unpacked it.
